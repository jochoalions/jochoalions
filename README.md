- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jorge.
- ðŸ‘€ I am very interested in Agent-based Modeling.
- ðŸŒ± I am returning to programming after a few decades..  My graduate work in computer science was all done in C on Unix, and Icon. (1980's)  My professional programming work was mostly done in concurrent Pascal (VAX-VMS) and C (embedded on a PowerPC). So I have a lot of catching up to do, and first in the list is to take a deep dive into Python. A few solid examples will go a long way.
